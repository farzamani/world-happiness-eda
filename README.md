# World Happiness Record 2021
This is my assignment project for Exploratory Data Analysis from IBM.
I use datasets from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021

In this notebook, I implemented all of this Exploratory Data Analysis course material: data cleaning, visualization, simple EDA, hypothesis testing, etc. Datasets that I use are from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021. The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors â€“ economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. The data is presented using several visualization tools: histogram, barplot, scatterplot, and line plot. These visualizations could give us a better view when we look at the data.
